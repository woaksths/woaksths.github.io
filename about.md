I am first year MS student in Computer Science at Yonsei University. Previously, I was an undergraduate student at Ajou University from which I received a B.S in Computer Science in 2019. My main interests lie on the Natural Language Processing from understanding their mechanism to applying them to real world problems. Most of my blog posts will be on theses topics. Feel free to comments or questions if you find something to discuss in my posts.
